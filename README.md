# CV Application

A simple and basic application that takes in form data and generates a rudimentary CV in a form of a PDF.

## Features

- Editable forms
- PDF Generation

## Tools Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML + CSS**
- **React + Vite**
- **[jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for PDF Exports**

## Why I Built This

For practicing React!! I have been building applications with vanilla HTML + CSS + JS for the vast majority of my
projects
so building a relatively simple project like this helped me understand concepts such as React states and how it
re-renders, etc.

## Potential Improvements

- Give the user the ability to add more experience to the `Experience` section
- **Add mobile support!** Right now, the UI for mobile looks terrible ðŸ˜­
- Add more functionality for styling the PDF export.
    - Or add a PDF preview window!

## Screenshots

Will add them soon!
